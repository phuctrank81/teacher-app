1/I’d like to work at Saigon Digital because I really admire how the company combines creativity, technology, and strategy to help businesses grow.
As someone who’s passionate about backend development and automation, I’m excited to join a team that works with modern technologies like JAMstack and AI tools.
I believe Saigon Digital’s dynamic environment and focus on innovation will be the perfect place for me to learn, contribute, and grow as a developer.
2/During my 2-month internship, I gained solid hands-on experience working in an IT environment, especially with Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP.
I practiced setting up domain controllers, managing users and groups through Group Policy Objects (GPO), and configuring key network services.
What I liked most was the team environment — I learned how to collaborate, solve real issues, and apply what I studied to actual infrastructure systems.    
4/
In the next 2 to 5 years, my goal is to grow from a front-end developer into a more well-rounded engineer who also understands backend and automation systems.
I know that I’m still at the beginning and don’t have deep experience in backend yet, but I’m really interested in learning more about it — especially working with APIs and cloud technologies like AWS EC2, S3, and Lambda.
If I have the opportunity, I’d like to develop my skills step by step and eventually grow into a junior or even senior backend or automation engineer in the future.
